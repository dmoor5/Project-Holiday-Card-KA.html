        <h1>Merry Christmas!</h1>
        <p> Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ,
        <br> observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration<br> among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian
        <br>
        liturgical year, it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and <br>
        initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve<br> days and culminates on Twelfth Night; in some traditions, Christmastide<br>
        includes an octave. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's<br>
        nations, is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as<br>
        culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the holiday<br>
        season centered around it. </p>
